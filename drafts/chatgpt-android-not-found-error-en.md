When using the ChatGPT Android app, you may sometimes see “Message failed to send” followed by a “Not Found” error. Although it looks serious, this issue is usually not caused by your message or account.

## Why this happens

This error occurs when the conversation ID stored in the app no longer exists on the server. In technical terms, the app sends a request to a resource that has already expired, resulting in a 404‑type response.

**Common triggers include:**

*   Sending a message after the app has been in the background for a while
*   Switching between Wi‑Fi and mobile data
*   Very long conversation threads
*   Temporary server congestion

The content, language, or length of your message is not the cause.

## How to fix it

The most reliable solution is simple: **start a new chat and resend the same message**. In most cases, this resolves the problem immediately.

If the issue persists, try restarting the app, toggling airplane mode, or using the web version of ChatGPT.

**Avoid retrying in the same conversation thread**, as the expired conversation ID may continue to trigger the error.

## Important notes

This error does not indicate account restrictions, policy violations, or bans. It is a temporary session mismatch and has no negative impact on your account.

## Conclusion

If you encounter a “Not Found” error in ChatGPT, switch to a new chat and continue your work. It is a common, harmless issue related to session handling, not a problem with your input.
