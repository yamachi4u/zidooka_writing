## The Result

I ran Claude 4.5 Opus through Copilot Agent for an entire day. The total cost? **About $10**.

## My Honest Take

Not bad at all. Actually, it's **insanely cheap**.

$10 is roughly the cost of hiring someone for one hour. But with this, I got a full day of code writing, documentation, and bug fixes.

## As a Direct Cost

When you think about this as a direct cost for development:

- Hiring a developer: $15/hour × 8 hours = $120
- Claude 4.5 Opus for a full day: ~$10

That's **one-twelfth** the cost. And Claude doesn't get tired, doesn't need breaks, and doesn't complain.

## Takeaway

AI development tools are no longer "too expensive to use." With pay-as-you-go pricing at this level, there's no reason NOT to use it.

This is a game-changer.
