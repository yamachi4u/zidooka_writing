Starting around 23:30 on January 13, 2026, a major outage is occurring on X (formerly Twitter).
Many users are seeing the error message **"Something went wrong. Try reloading."**, and timelines are failing to load properly.

## Symptoms

The following error is displayed on both the PC browser version and some mobile apps:

```
Something went wrong. Try reloading.
```

Clicking the "Retry" button typically results in the same error appearing repeatedly without resolving the issue.

## Outage Status (As of 2026/01/13 23:50)

**Occurrence Time:** From approx. 23:36, Jan 13, 2026

Reports on outage tracking sites like Downdetector have spiked sharply starting at this time.

This is highly likely a **server-side failure at X (Twitter)**, not an issue with your internet connection or device.

## Solution

**【Conclusion】The only solution currently is to wait for recovery.**

- Clearing your browser cache or re-logging in will likely not fix the issue in most cases.
- **We recommend waiting** without logging out, as the outage might prevent you from logging back in.

We will update this article or post a follow-up once the service is restored.
