When you copy a link from ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini, you may notice something extra added to the URL:

`?utm_source=chatgpt.com`

:::note
At first glance, this looks harmless.

:::warning
But in practice, these tracking parameters often cause small but persistent problems—especially when you share links in Slack, Notion, documentation, or blog posts.

That is why **Remove ChatGPT UTM** exists.

## What problem does this tool solve?

Modern AI tools frequently append tracking parameters such as:

- `utm_source=chatgpt.com`
- `utm_source=perplexity.ai`
- `utm_source=gemini.google.com`

These parameters are useful for analytics, but they also create friction:

- URLs look messy and unprofessional
- The same page appears as multiple URLs in analytics tools
- Shared links become harder to read and trust
- Copy-pasted links pollute internal documents and chats

If you care about clean URLs, this quickly becomes annoying.

## What is Remove ChatGPT UTM?

**Remove ChatGPT UTM** is a small, browser-based utility that removes AI-related tracking parameters from URLs.

It works instantly, directly in your browser, with no server processing.

You simply paste your URLs, and the tool outputs clean versions—ready to share.

### Cleaning options

The tool lets you choose how aggressively to clean URLs:

- Remove `utm_source=chatgpt.com` only
- Remove other AI referrers
- Remove all UTM parameters

Supported AI referrers include:

- `chatgpt.com`
- `perplexity.ai`
- `gemini.google.com`
- `claude.ai`
- `bing.com`

This makes it useful not only for ChatGPT users, but for anyone working with AI-assisted research or writing.

## Typical use cases

This tool is especially helpful if you:

- Share links frequently in Slack or Notion
- Maintain technical documentation or internal wikis
- Write blog posts and want canonical-looking URLs
- Care about analytics consistency
- Prefer clean, readable links in general

It is designed for developers, writers, researchers, and teams who value clarity over tracking noise.

## How it works

:::step
1. Paste one or multiple URLs (one per line)
2. Select your cleaning options
3. Copy the cleaned URLs
:::

All processing happens locally in your browser.
No data is sent to a server, and nothing is stored.

## Why this tool exists

AI tools are becoming part of everyday workflows.
As a result, AI-generated links are everywhere.

Instead of fighting that trend, this tool accepts reality and fixes one small, concrete problem that comes with it.

Clean URLs may seem like a minor detail—but over time, details like this shape how readable, reliable, and maintainable your work becomes.

:::conclusion
If you are tired of seeing `utm_source=chatgpt.com` attached to otherwise clean links, this tool does exactly one thing—and does it well.
