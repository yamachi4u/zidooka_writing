To be honest, I'm aware I've been using it a bit too much.
A few dollars a month, and before I knew it, it was around $20.
Looking only at the numbers, that's a fair amount.

But after re-reading the logs from the past few weeks, my thinking became clear.

This is not waste.
At least not for how I'm using it now.

Let's break down what I'm actually paying for.

I'm not paying for "answers" or "copy" itself.
What I'm buying is:

*   Speed of turning thoughts into words
*   Time saved in iterative trial-and-error
*   The process of turning failures into tangible assets

For example:

*   Organizing why a technical problem occurred
*   Articulating why I chose a particular architecture
*   Drafting the core idea for an article or a summary hub

I can do these alone, but they drain a lot of time and focus.
It's close to outsourcing — but to speed and clarity rather than a finished product.

The line between consumption and investment is clear.

Whether AI usage is "consumption" or an "investment" depends on what remains after using it.
What I'm doing now connects directly to at least one of these outcomes:

*   It becomes an article
*   It contributes to a summary hub's design
*   It can be revisited and reused later

Most chat interactions don't just disappear into the void — they become content.
So, rather than feeling like money spent, it feels like increasing assets.

About the $20–30/month threshold

Think about it calmly: 3,000–4,500 JPY a month,
and you get:

*   Several more articles
*   Clearer structure across topics
*   A logged record of your thought process

If that combination is what you want, it's a healthy investment.
Like server or domain costs, it doesn't feel "necessary," but it accelerates progress.

At this phase, I don't see a reason to be stingy.

Conclusion

At least for now, I judge AI usage to be an aggressive, worthwhile investment.
The goal isn't to "use it up" but to create an environment where I can throw things at it without hesitation.

The simple loop: use → shape → publish.
That's what I'll keep running for a while.
