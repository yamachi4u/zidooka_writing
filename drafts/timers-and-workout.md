There are countless work timers and workout timers in the world.
However, when you actually try to use them, you often find yourself slightly frustrated.

- Too many settings
- Account registration required
- Distracting ads
- Slow to load

So, at ZIDOOKA Tools, I collected only **"timers that you can use immediately upon opening."**

## What is Timers & Workout?

**Timers & Workout** is a collection of minimalist timers for work and exercise.

All tools share the following characteristics:

- Runs entirely in the browser
- No configuration required
- One page, one function
- No explanation needed

:::note
I believe a timer should not be a "tool to think about," but a tool that lets you start immediately.

## Available Timers

### Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro timer with 25 minutes of work + 5 minutes of break.
It is the minimal configuration for segmenting your focus time.

### Simple Tabata Timer

A standard Tabata training timer for 4 minutes (20s exercise / 10s rest × 8 sets).

You don't need to think about settings before exercising.

### Simple HIIT Timer

A slightly more relaxed HIIT timer for 10 minutes (30s exercise / 30s rest).

Suitable when you want to move your body for a short time.

## Why stick to "Simple"?

I believe timers do not need to be high-function tools.

All that is necessary is:

- Measures accurately
- Can be used without hesitation
- Does not get in the way

The more features you add, the more "time spent thinking before using" increases.

At ZIDOOKA Tools, I have cut out that extra time as much as possible.

## Who is this for?

These tools are suitable if you:

- Want to start working or exercising immediately
- Are satisfied with the same settings every time
- Like light and quiet tools
- Don't want to increase the number of apps

Conversely, it may not be suitable for those who enjoy detailed customization.

## Summary

:::conclusion
**Timers & Workout** is a tool collection that consciously aims for **"just the right amount of unfriendliness."**

It doesn't explain too much, doesn't let you set too much, and just quietly fulfills its role.

It is enough if you use it only when you need it, for as long as you need it.
