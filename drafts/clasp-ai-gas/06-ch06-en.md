**What you will be able to do in this chapter**:
*   Import cloud changes with `clasp pull`
*   Iron rules to prevent "reversion" accidents
*   First step of team development
*   **Time required**: 10 minutes (reading only)
*   **Stumbling block**: Editing in browser and losing data (It happens often)

I will explain the difference between `clasp push` and `clasp pull`, and `clasp clone` to copy an existing project. If you understand these, you will be able to synchronize code freely in any situation.

## 1. Imagine the flow of data

When using Clasp, the scariest thing is "file reversion (overwrite accident)".
To prevent this, let's firmly imagine how data moves.

### Push
- **Direction**: Your PC -> Google
- **Meaning**: "My code at hand is the latest. Please overwrite with this."
- **Command**: `clasp push`

### Pull
- **Direction**: Google -> Your PC
- **Meaning**: "The code on Google is the latest. Please update the files at hand."
- **Command**: `clasp pull`

## 2. Bring an existing project to hand (Clone)

In Chapter 4, we created a new project with `clasp create`, but in practice, you will often want to edit **"GAS already running"** or **"GAS linked to a spreadsheet"**.

In such cases, use **`clasp clone`**.
This is a command to download the entire GAS project on the cloud to your PC.

### When to use?
- When you want to manage GAS made in the browser in the past with VS Code in earnest.
- When you want to copy GAS made by a team member to your PC and help.
- When you replace your PC and rebuild the development environment.

### Step 1: Find Script ID!
To clone, you need the **Script ID** which is the "address" of that GAS. It is not the URL.

1.  Open the target GAS editor in the browser.
2.  Click **"Project Settings"** (gear icon ⚙️) from the menu on the left.
3.  Copy the long random string in the item "ID".

### Step 2: Execute command
In the terminal, move to the folder (parent folder) where you want to place the project, and type the following.

```bash
# clasp clone <copied script ID>
clasp clone 1A2b3C4d5E6f......
```

If successful, a new folder is created in the current folder, and `.js` files and `appsscript.json` are downloaded into it.
With this, preparation for local development is complete! Let's enter that folder with `cd` and start working.

## 3. "Dual Wielding" you must absolutely not do

The thing you must absolutely not do is **"Edit in local (VS Code) while also editing in browser"**.
If you do this, a tragedy will occur.

### 😱 Scenario of Tragedy
1.  Make "Feature A" in **Local**.
2.  `clasp push`. (Feature A is reflected in the cloud)
3.  Open **Browser**, make a minor fix (Feature B) and save.
4.  Return to **Local** and make "Feature C".
    - *At this time, "Feature B" does not exist in Local!*
5.  `clasp push`.

<!-- Insert diagram showing "mismatch between local and cloud" here -->

**Result**: "Feature B" made in the browser disappears!
Because Clasp assumes "local state is correct" and forcibly overwrites the cloud.
*By the way, even if the file on Google side disappears, it does not go into "Trash", so recovery is extremely difficult. (Details in Chapter 8)*

## 4. Iron Rule: Keep One Way

There is only one rule to prevent accidents.

> **"Always edit code only in Local (VS Code)"**

Please keep the browser editor only for "viewing" and "executing".
Even if you want to tweak the code in the browser, hold back and open VS Code.

### What if I corrected it in the browser by mistake?
There may be cases where you made an emergency fix from a smartphone or browser because you didn't have a PC while out.
In that case, be sure to type the following command before resuming work.

```bash
clasp pull
```

With this, you can import the changes made in the browser to local.

### [Preserved Version] Operation Template to prevent accidents
If you are anxious, be sure to follow this procedure before starting work.

1.  **Before starting work**: `clasp pull` (Get the latest state just in case)
2.  **During work**: Edit and save in VS Code
3.  **Work completion**: `clasp push` (Reflect to cloud)
4.  **Before major changes**: Commit with Git (*Explained in Chapter 9*)

"When working after a long time, first `pull`"
If you keep this, 90% of accidents can be prevented.

## 5. Ignore File Settings (.claspignore)

As the project gets bigger, "files you don't want to upload to Google" will appear.
For example, personal memos or test data.

What realizes this is a file called `.claspignore`.
Create it directly under the project folder and write as follows.

```text
# Write files and folders you want to ignore
memo.txt
test-data/**
.git/**
node_modules/**
```

Especially, the folder `node_modules` (place where libraries go) has a huge number of files, so trying to upload this will cause an error.
This setting becomes essential when doing full-scale development.

## 6. Convenient Feature: Auto Push (watch)

Is it troublesome to type `clasp push` every time?
In such a case, try using the following command.

```bash
clasp push --watch
```

While this is running, it **"automatically pushes every time you save a file (Ctrl+S)"**.
You can develop with the rhythm of save = reflect, just like a browser editor.
(Stop with `Ctrl + C` when finished)

## Frequently Asked Questions (Q&A)

### Q. Is it okay if I just fix a little in the browser?
**A. No!**
Carelessness like "It's just one character..." is the source of accidents.
The moment you fix and save in the browser, a "contradiction" occurs with the local code.
If you `clasp push` from local after that, the fix in the browser is mercilessly overwritten and disappears.
Please thoroughly implement **"Fix always in VS Code"**.

### Q. Do I do `clasp clone` many times?
**A. Basically only once at the beginning.**
Once you bring it to local, you just need to continue development in that folder.
However, if you change PC or want to work in another folder, you can `clone` again.

Up to here, you have mastered the basic usage of Clasp.
From the next chapter, we will change the perspective a little and talk about practical things like "how to use in actual business".
