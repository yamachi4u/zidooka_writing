This series is a practical guide for **"busy sole proprietors"** and **"staff in small companies"** to automate their own work.

"I want to eliminate daily routine work."
"I can't afford to hire anyone, but I need help."
"I've never done programming, but I want to do something about it."

I wrote this for you.

What you will learn in this series is not just how to write GAS (Google Apps Script).
It is how to create **"your own digital secretary who works 24/7 without complaining"** with your own hands.

## Why "Clasp" for busy you?

"I don't have time to study programming!"
You might think so. However, **because you are busy, you should use the strongest weapon**.

By using a tool called Clasp and using the same tools as professional engineers (VS Code), the learning cost drops dramatically.

1.  **AI (Copilot) writes for you**:
    - This is the biggest reason.
    - If you write "Aggregate sales data" in English (or Japanese), AI will write the code.
    - You just need to be the "director". You don't need to memorize code from scratch.

2.  **Even if you fail, you can undo with "Ctrl+Z"**:
    - It's scary to break tools used in business.
    - With this method, you can return to the "working state" anytime, like a save point in a game.
    - You can try and error with peace of mind.

3.  **Get "efficiency skills" for a lifetime**:
    - The usage of "black screen (terminal)" and "VS Code" learned here can be applied to all IT tasks other than GAS.
    - Your business combat power should be orders of magnitude higher by the time you finish reading this series.

## The future you get with this series

By the time you finish reading this series, you will be able to do the following:

- **Liberation from copy-paste work every morning**: GAS creates a report while you are drinking coffee.
- **Eradication of mistakes**: Input mistakes that always happen when humans do it become zero.
- **Transformation into "IT-savvy manager/staff"**: You will be able to create small tools yourself without relying on external vendors.

Without difficult theories, I will explain focusing only on **"usable from today"** and **"useful in the field"**.
Now, let's go on a journey to accelerate your business!
- **Environment construction power**: The power to install and configure development tools on your PC.
- **VS Code utilization**: The power to master the world's strongest editor.
- **AI pair programming**: Essential skills for modern engineers to write code in cooperation with AI.

## Target Audience

- People who want to improve business efficiency but feel the limits of the browser GAS editor
- People who have no programming experience but admire a full-fledged development environment
- People who hated the "black screen" without trying
- People looking for teaching materials to teach GAS to new employees
