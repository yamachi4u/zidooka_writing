**What you will be able to do in this chapter**:
*   Be able to imagine the difference between "local" and "cloud"
*   Eliminate the fear of "black screen (terminal)"
*   **Time required**: 10 minutes (reading only)
*   **Stumbling block**: Overwhelmed by many terms (It's OK to just say "hmm" for now!)

"I'm scared of the black screen", "What is local?"
For you, I will explain the "basic terms" and "mindset" that cannot be avoided when using Clasp, with zero technical jargon.

## 1. What are "Local" and "Cloud"?

Before using Clasp, let's clarify the difference between these two words.
If you compare it to a restaurant, it looks like this.

### Local (Your PC) = "Kitchen"
- **Place**: Inside the computer in front of you.
- **Role**: **"Place for trial and cooking"**.
- **Features**:
    - Kitchen knives and cutting boards (convenient tools) are available, making work easy.
    - Even if you fail and break a plate, the customer won't know.
    - Just making it here doesn't reach the customer (user) yet.

### Cloud (Google) = "Guest Seating (Hall)"
- **Place**: The other side of the Internet.
- **Role**: **"Place to serve food"**.
- **Features**:
    - Operating 24/7 for customers.
    - Cooking directly here is like using fire in front of customers, which is dangerous and inefficient.

The role of Clasp is like a **waiter who carries the food made in the "kitchen (local)" to the "guest seating (cloud)"**.
Until now, it was hard because you were "cooking directly on the guest table (development in browser)".

## 2. Let's eliminate the fear of "Black Screen (Terminal)"

That black screen with only characters that programmers use.
We call that **"Terminal"**.

I understand the feeling of pulling back saying "It looks difficult... like a hacker...".
But if you are a manager or leader, please think like this.

**"This is a chat tool to a 'super competent but silent subordinate' called a computer"**

Mouse operation (GUI) is like tapping a subordinate on the shoulder and gesturing "do this". It is intuitive, but difficult to give detailed instructions.
On the other hand, Terminal (CUI) is a tool to "give clear instructions with words (characters)".

- You: `mkdir my-project` (Make a folder named my-project)
- PC: (Executes silently)
- You: `cd my-project` (Go inside it)
- PC: (Executes silently)

That's it.
You just send **fixed phrases called "commands"** via chat.
It uses English abbreviations, but you don't need to memorize them. You can just type while looking at a cheat sheet.

### Supplement for Windows users: Which one should I use?
There are several types in Windows such as "PowerShell", "Command Prompt", "Git Bash", but **any of them is OK**.
In this series, we will explain assuming Windows standard **"PowerShell"**.

### Just remember this! Basic 3 words
If you can use just these at first, business will go around.

1.  **`cd` (Change Directory)**: "Move"
    - `cd Desktop`: Move to Desktop.
2.  **`ls` (List)**: "Show contents"
    - Displays a list of files in the current folder.
    - *In Windows Command Prompt it is `dir`, but `ls` can also be used in PowerShell. Let's remember **"either is fine"**.*
3.  **`mkdir` (Make Directory)**: "Make a folder"
    - `mkdir 2025-project`: Create a new folder.

## 3. Concept of address called "Path"

There is one more important concept. That is **"Path"**.
This is the "address" of the file.

### Absolute path and relative path
- **Absolute path**: Formal address written from the root like `C:\Users\name\Desktop`. Image of writing from "Minato-ku, Tokyo...".
- **Relative path**: Route from where you are now like `.\data`. Image of "2 houses next to here".

### Frequently used symbols
- **`.` (One dot)**: "Current location (here)"
- **`..` (Two dots)**: "One level up (parent folder)"
    - Example: You can return to the previous folder with `cd ..`.

### When there is a space in the folder name
If there is a space like `My Project`, the command will be cut off and recognized.
In that case, enclose it with **quotes (single or double)** like `'My Project'`.

When using Clasp, you basically "move into the project folder (`cd`)" and then work, so you don't type complicated paths much.
It is okay if you remember "If you get lost, check current location with `ls`".

> **Point of this chapter**
> The story so far is **more important to "get used to" than to "understand completely"**.
> Even if you don't understand now, you will understand "Ah, this is what it means" while moving your hands.
> Let's proceed without fear!

## 4. Development Cycle: Past and Future

### Past GAS development (Browser only)
1. Open browser.
2. Write click-click on a narrow screen.
3. Delete by mistake and turn pale.
4. Work ends if the net is cut.

### GAS development using Clasp (Modern development)
1. Write code comfortably consulting with AI in **Local (Kitchen)**.
2. Save in **Local**. (Can work without net!)
3. Type `clasp push` (Serve!) in the terminal.
4. Check if it works in the browser.

It looks like one more step, but **productivity of "thinking/writing" time is different**, so work finishes overwhelmingly faster in total.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (Q&A)

### Q1. Will my PC break if I type a strange command on the black screen?
**A. Basically it's okay.**
The PC will not break with commands like `cd` or `mkdir` used this time.
However, caution is required for `rm` (delete) command etc., but we only use safe commands in this series.

### Q2. Is it okay if I'm not good at English?
**A. No problem.**
The words that appear are fixed. Like "make directory" -> `mkdir`, it becomes easier to remember if you know the origin.

**What to do in the next chapter**:
*   Install Node.js (something like an engine)
*   Install Clasp (tool to communicate with Google)
*   Finally type commands on the black screen!
