## Goal of this chapter
- **Objective**: Concretely imagine "what you can do" with GAS and Clasp.
- **Time required**: 5 minutes
- **Note**: We won't write code yet. Just getting excited is OK.

"I want to improve business efficiency, but programming is impossible..."
I want you to read this series if you think so.
GAS is a tool to automate Google services, and Clasp is a "magic wand" to make that work 10 times easier.

## 1. What is GAS (Google Apps Script)?

In a nutshell, it is **"an excellent robot that Google lends you for free, working 24/7"**.
It works while you sleep without complaining or asking for overtime pay.

### It does these things for you
You don't need to brace yourself for "programming". What GAS is good at is doing the "plain and troublesome work" you usually do on your behalf.

1.  **Automation of invoice processing (Gmail x Drive x Spreadsheet)**:
    - "When an email with 'Invoice' in the subject comes, save the attachment to the '2025 Invoices' folder in Drive, and record the amount and company name in the Spreadsheet ledger."
    - **Effect**: End-of-month administrative work becomes zero.
2.  **Immediate customer response (Form x Calendar x Mail)**:
    - "When a contact comes from the inquiry form, immediately send a thank-you email, tentatively reserve a schedule on the calendar, and notify myself via chat."
    - **Effect**: Response speed increases and opportunity loss is prevented.
3.  **Monitoring inventory and sales (Spreadsheet x Slack/Chatwork)**:
    - "When the inventory count drops below '5', notify the smartphone 'Please order!'."
    - **Effect**: "Careless mistakes" such as out-of-stock and ordering errors disappear.

The biggest attraction of GAS is that you can realize these **for free without paying high system introduction costs**.

## 2. What is Clasp (Command Line Apps Script Projects)?

It is read as "Clasp".
Think of this as **"a translator to give instructions more efficiently to the robot called GAS"**.

Usually, you write GAS code in a browser. However, using Clasp, you can **send instructions written on your computer (local environment) to GAS in an instant**.

### Why use "Clasp" specifically?
You might think, "If I can write in a browser, that's fine."
However, **"busy you" should use Clasp**. The reason is simple.

**"Because you can bring out 100% of the power of AI (Copilot)"**

In the browser editor, AI support functions are limited.
However, if you use Clasp and use a high-function editor (VS Code) on your computer, you can get an environment where **"AI writes code just by writing what you want to do in English (or Japanese)"**.

### Comparison: Browser vs Clasp (VS Code)

| Feature | Development in Browser (Traditional) | Clasp + VS Code (Recommended) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Support** | △ (Copy-paste required) | **◎ (Real-time suggestions)** |
| **Development Speed** | Normal | **Explosive speed (Powerful completion)** |
| **Safety** | △ (Gone if deleted by mistake) | **◎ (Can revert from history)** |
| **Difficulty** | Easy | Setup required only at first |
| **Recommendation** | Minor fixes | **Creating tools for business** |

In this series, we dare to choose the path of Clasp which "requires setup only at first".
Because once you overcome that first hurdle, **AI, the strongest partner**, will help you.

## 3. Frequently Asked Questions (Q&A)

I will answer questions that beginners tend to have.

### Q1. Is it really free?
**A. Yes, it is basically free.**
Anyone with a Google account (Gmail address) can use it.
However, there are limits such as "up to 100 emails per day". You won't have trouble using it for personal or small-scale business.

### Q2. Is it okay if I'm not good at computers?
**A. If you can "copy and paste", you are fine.**
In this series, we will focus on explaining "how to get AI to write" and "how to use convenient tools" rather than memorizing difficult code.
If you proceed according to the procedure, you can definitely create something that works.

### Q3. Can I do it on Mac or Windows?
**A. Both are OK!**
The screen appearance is slightly different, but what you do is exactly the same.

## 4. Understanding Check Quiz

Let's review the points of this chapter.

A. No need to pay Google
B. Can program on smartphone
C. Can develop using high-function tools (AI etc.) on PC

**Q3. What is the goal of this series?**
A. Memorize all programming languages
B. Become able to automate easily using convenient tools (Clasp/VS Code/AI)
C. Become able to type without looking at the keyboard

<summary>Answer Check (Click to open)</summary>

**Q1: B**
GAS is a robot that works on your behalf.

**Q2: C**
Using Clasp allows you to use powerful weapons like VS Code and Copilot.

**Q3: B**
The goal is to "take it easy" using convenient tools, not to learn with difficulty.

From the next chapter, we will actually create that environment.
"Black screens" will appear, but there is no need to be afraid. Anyone can do it if they follow the procedure!
However, professional engineers rarely use browser editors. Because **browser editors are "Notepad" level, and PC editors (VS Code) are "Magic Wand" level**.
