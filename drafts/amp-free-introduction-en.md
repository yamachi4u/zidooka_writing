A groundbreaking service has emerged in the AI coding space. **Amp** (Ampcode) has announced a new tier called **"Amp Free"**, offering a staggering amount of free daily credits to developers.

## What is Amp Free?

Amp is an AI coding agent integrated into editors like VS Code. The new "Free" tier is ad-supported but comes with a massive benefit:

- 【Conclusion】You get a **$10 daily grant** (approx. $300/month value) to use frontier models like **Claude Opus 4.5** for free.
- 【Point】This is not a "dumbed down" free tier. You get full access to the `smart` mode driven by the most powerful models available.

## Available Models: Opus 4.5 & GPT-5

According to their documentation (as of Jan 2026), the credits allow you to use:

1.  **Smart Mode:** Powered by **Claude Opus 4.5**.
2.  **Rush Mode:** Powered by **Haiku 4.5** (for speed).
3.  **Oracle:** Uses **GPT-5** for reasoning tasks.
4.  **Subagents:** Uses **Gemini 3**.

This multi-model approach ensures you have the best tool for every detailed coding task.

## The Catch: Strict Verification

Because giving away $10/day of expensive inference is costly, Amp implements strict abuse prevention.

> 【Note】Identity verification is very strict.
> You must sign up with a real name and a real email address (no throwaways).

As seen in user reports, accounts flagged as "suspicious" or potentially automated are blocked from the free grant until they can "convince" the team they are human.

## How to Start?

1.  Visit [ampcode.com](https://ampcode.com/).
2.  Connect your GitHub account.
3.  Install the extension for VS Code, JetBrains, or use the Command Line Interface (CLI).
4.  If approved, your balance will top up by $10 every day.

This effectively democratizes access to high-end AI coding agents that previously cost hundreds of dollars a month in usage fees.
