# ChatGPT "You can now make multiple images at a time" — It's Not an Error, It's a Feature Announcement

![You can now ask ChatGPT to make multiple images at a time.](../images/スクリーンショット%202025-12-16%20133951.png)

While generating images in ChatGPT, this message suddenly appeared:

> **Create another image while you wait**
> 
> You can now ask ChatGPT to make multiple images at a time.

At first, I thought "Is this an error?" but it turned out to be **not an error or warning, but an announcement of a new feature**.

## What Changed

Previously, when generating images in ChatGPT:

1. Request image generation
2. Wait until generation completes
3. Request next image

This **sequential waiting flow** was standard.

But with this update,

**You can now request the next image even while one is generating**

## How Can You Use This?

For example, you can use it like this:

**Case 1: Create variations in batch**

- "Create an image of the ocean"
- (While generating) "Now create a river image too"
- (And then) "Also a night harbor image"

→ They're queued and processed in the background together

**Case 2: Corrections and new requests in parallel**

- "Make this image brighter"
- (Without waiting) "Also, create a cat image"

→ Wait time is effectively halved

## Important Point: It's Not an Error

When this message appears, you might think:

- "Did I make some mistake?"
- "Did I hit some limit?"

But it's **completely the opposite**.

It's **an announcement that things got more convenient**,
so feel free to keep requesting images without worry.

## Real Usage Experience

When you actually use it, **the wait time becomes much less noticeable**.

Especially in scenarios like:

- "Create 3 variations of this pattern"
- "I want all versions of A, B, and C"

The perceived work time is significantly shortened.

Previously, it was:
"1st image → wait → 2nd image → wait → 3rd image → wait"

Now it's:
"Request 3 images together → wait for all"

The feeling has changed.

## Which Plans Can Use This?

This feature is available on:

- **ChatGPT Plus (Paid Plan)**
- **ChatGPT Pro**

Since the free plan has limitations on image generation itself,
this simultaneous generation feature is presumably primarily for paid plans.

## Summary

- **Multiple simultaneous image generation** is now possible in ChatGPT
- You can request the next image while one is generating
- **It's a feature announcement, not an error**
- Effective wait time is reduced

The more frequently you generate images, the greater the benefit of this change.

"Let me throw in the next request while I'm waiting"
is likely to become the new normal.
