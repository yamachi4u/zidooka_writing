I recently started building a small collection of browser-based tools.

There is no big launch announcement, no bold claim about “changing the world,” and no complex backend.
Just small utilities that solve everyday problems, one by one.

## Why I built this site

Over time, I noticed a pattern in my own work.

I often needed very simple tools:

- quick date calculations
- small text cleanup utilities
- lightweight document helpers
- one-purpose calculators

:::note
Most existing tools were either overloaded with features or buried under ads.
I wanted something faster, simpler, and predictable.

So I decided to build my own.

## What these tools have in common

Every tool on the site follows the same basic rules:

- Runs entirely in the browser
- No sign-ups
- No uploads to a server
- One clear purpose per page

If a tool cannot explain itself in one sentence, it does not belong here.

## Not a product, just utilities

This is not a SaaS in the usual sense.

There are no dashboards, no accounts, and no usage limits.
You open a page, do one thing, and leave.

That is intentional.

:::warning
These tools are designed to be used occasionally, not lived in.

## Built gradually, not all at once

I am adding tools slowly.

Some ideas come from my own workflow.
Others come from small frustrations that repeat over time.

When a problem shows up more than once, it is probably worth turning into a tool.

## Who this is for

These tools are useful if you:

- prefer simple solutions over complex platforms
- work with text, dates, or files daily
- value speed and clarity
- want tools that “just work” and then get out of the way

If that sounds familiar, you might find something useful here.

## The site

The tools are collected here:

[https://tools.zidooka.com/](https://tools.zidooka.com/)

There is no recommended starting point.
Just pick what you need, when you need it.

## Moving forward

This is a long-term project.

I plan to keep adding small tools whenever a clear use case appears.
No roadmap, no pressure—just steady accumulation.

:::conclusion
If even a few of these utilities save someone a minute or two, that is enough.
