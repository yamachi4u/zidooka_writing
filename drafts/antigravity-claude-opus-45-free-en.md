# Claude Opus 4.5 Works on Antigravity's Free Tier — The Docs Were Right

![Claude Opus 4.5 working on Antigravity](../images/image%20copy%203.png)

**Key Takeaway:** Confirmed that Claude Opus 4.5 is usable on Antigravity's free account (no subscription) as of January 15, 2026.

## Skeptical, But It Worked

The official Antigravity documentation mentioned that Claude Opus 4.5 was available.
Honestly, I was skeptical.

"Can the latest Opus really work on a free account?"
"There must be some catch, right?"

I tried it anyway, and **it just worked**.

## This Is a Great Deal

Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's flagship model.
Using it via API typically costs a fair amount.

Being able to use it on Antigravity's free tier, even to some extent, is **pretty amazing value**.

Of course, heavy usage probably won't fly.
There are surely limits on the free tier, and rate limiting is likely in place.

But for:

- Quick questions
- Testing Opus response quality
- Light tasks

It seems perfectly usable.

## Worth Trying Out

If you've been wanting to try Opus but hesitant about paying, give Antigravity a shot.

**Note:** Free access to the latest Opus model is rare. It's practical enough for light tasks.

Keep in mind that terms and limits could change in the future, so try it while you can.
