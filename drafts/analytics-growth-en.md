I took a look at the traffic by country in Google Analytics, and noticed some interesting trends.

![Country-specific Access Analysis](../images/2025/analytics-country-growth.png)

First, access from Japan continues to account for the majority of the total, but it is showing solid growth of **+22%** year-over-year. Engagement time has also increased from **16 seconds to 25 seconds**, giving the impression that more readers are taking the time to read technical articles carefully.

On the other hand, the movement from the United States was quite significant.
It increased drastically from **4 to 15 (+275%)**.
I feel this is the effect of the increasing number of error resolution articles I've been writing with English translations recently. The numbers are still small, but this is usually how it starts when you begin to get picked up by overseas search engines, so it looks like it's going to get fun from here.

China also saw a slight increase from 2 to 3. I also noticed new access coming in from countries like Indonesia, Sweden, Germany, and Singapore, albeit in small numbers, and I felt that the overall evaluation of the site is spreading outward.

It's still a small change, but the fact that technical documentation and error resolution articles are starting to reach a multinational audience seems to be a hint for future direction. I have a feeling that if I refine the quality of the English parts a bit more, it will spread even further.

Just a quick note for now.
