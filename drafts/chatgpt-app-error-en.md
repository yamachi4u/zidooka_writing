# Point: Try Reloading or Switching Models First

Hello, this is ZIDOOKA!
As of December 2025, many users are encountering a **"Something went wrong. ↻"** error while using the ChatGPT app on Android/iOS.

In short, this is usually caused by **"momentary network interruptions"** or **"server congestion"**.
It is rarely a critical bug, so please stay calm and try the following solutions.

# Reason: Why Does This Error Occur?

This error appears when the app fails to receive a response from the server.
It frequently happens in the following situations:

1.  **Network Glitches**: When moving (e.g., on a train) or switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data.
2.  **After Switching Models**: When switching from `GPT-4o` to `o1`, for example, causing a session state mismatch.
3.  **Server Congestion**: During peak hours when global traffic is high.

Especially recently (Dec 2025), with new model updates, the app behavior seems slightly unstable.

# Example: 5 Steps to Fix It

If you see this error, try these steps in order:

## 1. Tap the Reload Icon (↻)
Tap the circular arrow next to the error message. If it's a simple timeout, this will regenerate the response.

## 2. Switch Models
Try changing the model at the top of the screen (e.g., `GPT-4o` -> `GPT-4o mini`) and then switch back. This resets the session and often fixes the issue.

## 3. Switch Network
If you are on Wi-Fi, switch to Mobile Data (4G/5G), or vice versa.

## 4. Restart the App
Force close (kill) the app and open it again. This clears temporary glitches or memory issues.

## 5. Use the Web Version
If the app refuses to work, access [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) via Chrome or Safari. If the issue is specific to the app, the web version should work fine.

# Conclusion

The "Something went wrong" message is a generic error in the ChatGPT app.
It does not mean your phone is broken or your account is banned.

**Environment:**
*   Date: December 11, 2025
*   Device: Android ChatGPT Official App
*   Trigger: Frequent during model switching or unstable network conditions.

If it happens frequently, check the App Store or Google Play Store for updates.
