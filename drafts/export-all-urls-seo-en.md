# Conclusion: Hire AI as Your Editor-in-Chief

Hello, this is ZIDOOKA!
Every long-running blog eventually faces the same problem: **"Too many articles, lost overview."**

With over 340 articles on ZIDOOKA!, I faced structural issues:
*   Mismatch between categories and actual search traffic.
*   Technical error articles spiking while other genres stagnated.
*   Valuable long-tail articles getting buried without internal links.

To solve this, I used the **"Export All URLs" plugin to extract all data and had ChatGPT perform an SEO diagnosis.**
The results were eye-opening. Here is how I did it.

# 1. What is "Export All URLs"?

It is a WordPress plugin that exports all your post URLs, titles, and categories into a CSV file.
You can access it via "Tools" -> "Export All URLs" in your dashboard.

**Key Data Points:**
*   URL
*   Title
*   Date
*   Post Type

This CSV acts as your "SEO Inventory Ledger."

# 2. The ChatGPT "Full Site Audit" Process

I uploaded the CSV to ChatGPT (GPT-4o) and ran the following analysis steps.

## Step 1: Overall Trend Analysis

I asked ChatGPT: "Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of this site based on the article list."

**ZIDOOKA! Analysis Results (Example):**
*   **Strength:** High E-E-A-T in "Technical Error Resolution." Consistent structure of "Cause x Experience x Screenshot x Timestamp."
*   **Feature:** Dual-language strategy (English/Japanese) covers global search intent effectively.

It objectively verbalized strengths I hadn't fully realized myself.

## Step 2: Mapping Search Intent

Next, I asked it to cluster articles based on "Search Intent."

*   **Troubleshooting:** For users in a hurry to fix errors.
*   **Dev Tutorials:** For users wanting to learn GAS / WordPress / Copilot deeply.
*   **Tool Comparisons:** For users considering new tools.

This visualized "content clusters" that were invisible just by looking at WordPress categories.

## Step 3: Finding the "Gaps"

This was the biggest win. ChatGPT pointed out SEO opportunity losses:

*   "Some articles exist in English but lack a Japanese version."
*   "High search volume themes have only one thin article."
*   "Old articles (pre-2023) are ranking but contain outdated info."

Based on this, I created a prioritized "Rewrite List."

# 3. The Results

After implementing the fixes suggested by the audit:

1.  **Faster Indexing:** Internal linking of isolated articles improved crawler efficiency.
2.  **Site Consistency:** Clarified the site's theme, improving pages per session.
3.  **New Topic Discovery:** Found new angles like "Prevention" or "Tool Reviews" derived from error fixes.

# 4. How to Do It Yourself

The process is simple:

1.  **Install Plugin:** Install "Export All URLs" and export your CSV.
2.  **Upload to ChatGPT:** Use the Code Interpreter (Advanced Data Analysis) feature.
3.  **Enter Prompt:** Try this template:

```markdown
Here is the list of all articles on my blog.
Please perform an SEO analysis based on the following:

1. Define the site's "Expertise" based on title trends.
2. Cluster articles by topic and suggest category structure improvements.
3. Identify content gaps or missed opportunities.
```

# Summary: "All URLs x AI" is the Ultimate SEO Combo

As your article count grows, it becomes impossible for a human to grasp everything.
But for AI, more data means better analysis.

Hiring ChatGPT as your "Editor-in-Chief" to perform regular health checks is a smart strategy for personal blogs to survive in the age of content saturation.
