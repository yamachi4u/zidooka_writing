# Project Instructions for Copilot Agent

This repository uses GitHub Copilot (Chat/Agent). Always follow these rules before proposing code or content changes.

## Must-Read Files (read first)
- `PIPELINE_MANUAL.md`
- `docs/snippets/emphasis.md`

## Always Do
- Read the two must-read files before answering or applying changes.
- Cite the exact sections you followed (file path + heading) when relevant.
- If instructions conflict, prefer the more specific doc (snippets over general style).

## Never Do
- Guess without checking the two must-read files.
- Introduce formatting that diverges from the emphasis snippets.

## Style & Scope
- If present, align tone and structure with `ZIDOOKA_STYLE.md`.
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the user’s request.

## Responses
- When you reference guidance, include lines like: “Based on PIPELINE_MANUAL.md > <section> and docs/snippets/emphasis.md > <pattern>”.
