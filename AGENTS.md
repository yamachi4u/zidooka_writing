# AGENTS Guidelines

Scope: Applies to the entire repository.

## Must-Read
- `PIPELINE_MANUAL.md` (overall workflow/pipeline manual)
- `docs/snippets/emphasis.md` (standard emphasis patterns to use in outputs)

## Workflow
- Read both Must-Read files before answering or editing.
- Implement changes, then restate which sections you followed.
- Self-check: confirm output conforms to emphasis snippet patterns.

## Conventions
- Use only the emphasis patterns defined in `docs/snippets/emphasis.md` for highlighting key takeaways, cautions, or conclusions.
- Prefer concise, single-line emphasis where possible; avoid decorative emojis.
- For code, use inline backticks for identifiers and fenced blocks for multi-line code.

## Conflict Resolution
- If guidance conflicts, follow the more specific rule.
- Ask a clarifying question if uncertainty remains after reading the Must-Read files.
